# Comptetition Setup
You should Fork the repo and work completely on that fork.
You can modify any file, modify structure, can delete any file and use any framework for the client side.
You can't remove server side rending swig, which is used inside the app.js, in fact you probably don't need to touch it as it's working. Don't create subfolders inside of css html img folders, but you can create any folder inside the root folder and inside of the website you can load it as: /pub/FOLDERNAME/FILENAME

# Get Started
To start you have to install node.js, which you can [find here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
You can use 8.9.4 version.
Open terminal inside the root folder and type 
```npm i```
which install some packages for the project. Then
```node app.js```
After that you should see 
```Load from your browser at: http://localhost/```
open that link in yout browser and you should see the webside. You are ready to go.
